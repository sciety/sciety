## Summary
Peer Community in Neuroscience (PCI Neuro) is a community of neuroscientists  who peer-review and recommend unpublished preprints publicly available from open archives such as HAL, Zenodo, arXiv, OSF-preprints, and bioRxiv. The peer-review process of PCI Neuro is very similar to that of conventional journals, except that it is transparent; peer-reviews and editorial correspondence are published and open data and code are required. Preprints recommended by PCI Neuro are finalized, peer-reviewed articles that can be used and cited, like any other article published in a conventional journal. A refereed preprint by PCI Neuro is a reliable and high quality manuscript that does not need to be published in conventional journals, although further submission in a journal is possible.

## Evaluation model
### At submission, PCI
- Considers all types of articles (experimental work, theory, review, opinion, etc.)
- Does not impose any format or restrictions in terms of article length, number of figures or tables
- Considers anonymous submissions
- Welcomes preregistration submissions and preprint submissions based on preregistrations (with or without prior review)
- Makes sure that raw data, codes and scripts are available
- Helps authors to suggest appropriate recommenders to handle their article
- Informs authors within 20 days if no recommender can be found to handle the article

### During evaluation, PCI
- Evaluates only articles considered interesting by at least one of the many recommenders
- Provides explicit guidelines for the recommender handling the preprints (https://peercommunityin.org/2020/10/28/pci-recommender-guide/)
- Organizes rigorous peer-review (https://peercommunityin.org/2020/10/22/pci-reviewer-guide/)
- Provides technical assistance to authors, recommenders and reviewers
- Allows authors to follow the evaluation process of their article online
- Makes sure that recommenders obtain at least two reliable review reports before making editorial decisions on the original version of the article
- Makes sure that recommenders make an editorial decision that is reliable and respectful to the authors
 
### At the revision stage, PCI
- Communicates regularly with the authors to ensure that the revision process is performed correctly and in a timely manner.
- Allows the authors as much time as they need to revise their article.
