Sciety and Bonfire Unveil Federated Platform for Open Preprint Discourse

### **Subtitle**

Bringing research conversations from siloed platforms to a connected, discoverable, and rewarding open science network using ActivityPub.

Friday, October 25, 2025

### **Intro paragraph**

Sciety, in collaboration with Bonfire Networks, is launching a new federated platform to integrate and amplify discussions around preprints directly within the scholarly ecosystem. This solution aims to empower researchers by providing a dedicated, open, and trusted environment for sharing insights, connecting with peers, and gaining recognition for their contributions to scientific conversations, ultimately linking these discussions directly to the preprints themselves.

### **Problem paragraph**

Currently, a significant amount of valuable discussion about new research, particularly preprints, occurs on commercial, siloed social media platforms like X/Twitter, Bluesky, Slack, or via email. These conversations are often ephemeral, difficult to discover, and disconnected from the original research they pertain to. This fragmentation hinders fluid discourse around science and prevents it from being a recognized academic activity, making it challenging for researchers to easily share insights, connect with others, and receive proper attribution for their contributions.

### **Solution paragraph**

The Sciety/Bonfire Nlnet project directly addresses these problems by creating a community platform specifically designed for researchers to discuss preprints in an open, trusted environment, leveraging the existing work on Bonfire. This new platform will connect these conversations directly to Sciety, ensuring that comments and discussions appear alongside curated evaluations and reviews. By building on the ActivityPub protocol, the solution will enable decentralised communication, making these valuable discussions discoverable and reusable within a broader open science network.

### **Company leader quote**

"We believe that open science thrives on open conversation," says \[Name, Title, e.g., Naomi Penfold, Head of Product, Sciety\]. "Our collaboration with Bonfire, supported by NLnet, is a critical step towards integrating the dynamic discussions happening around preprints into the scholarly record. We're moving away from fragmented chats to a connected, recognized, and rewarding space for scientific discourse, ensuring that valuable insights are never lost."

### **How the product/service works**

Customers, primarily researchers and research communities, will be able to create their own discussion spaces on the Bonfire-powered platform. These spaces will be tailored for preprint discussions, with easy-to-use guides and support for setting them up. Once discussions are underway, the platform will automatically link these conversations back to the relevant preprints on Sciety, making them discoverable alongside existing curated evaluations. As a federated platform, it will also enable interoperability with other ActivityPub-compatible services, allowing for broader reach and engagement within the Fediverse. The platform will also focus on helping researchers gain recognition for their contributions by linking engagement to researcher profiles.

### **Customer quote**

"As a researcher, I'm constantly looking for better ways to discuss new findings with my peers," says \[Researcher Name, Affiliation\]. "The idea of having a dedicated, open space where those conversations are linked directly to the preprints and visible within the scholarly framework is a game-changer. It means our discussions will finally get the recognition and visibility they deserve, fostering a more collaborative and open scientific community."

## **FAQ**

### **Internal FAQs**

#### **Q1: What are the key milestones for this project?**

A1: The initial phase focuses on spinning up a test instance of the OpenScience flavor of Bonfire, documenting the story map and assumption map, and detailing these in blog posts. We'll also be considering the shape of our preprint flavor and the flow between Sciety and the Fediverse for conversations about preprints and preprint review.

#### **Q2: How will we ensure reproducible deployment?**

A2: A key outcome of this project is to establish a Bonfire network tailored for preprints, with reproducible deployment made possible via NixOS.

#### **Q3: What are the main risks identified for this project?**

A3: We have a dedicated space on our Miro board for documenting major risks as they emerge. We are also actively working on identifying assumptions we'll need to test to increase our confidence in the solution's viability, feasibility, usability, desirability, and ethical implications.

#### **Q4: How will we measure success for this project?**

A4: Success will be measured by the adoption of the platform by research communities, the volume and quality of discussions generated, the seamless integration of these discussions with Sciety, and the demonstrated ability for researchers to gain recognition for their contributions to scholarly discourse.

#### **Q5: What are the plans for future iterations beyond the initial launch?**

A5: Future iterations will focus on refining the user experience, expanding federation capabilities with other relevant Fediverse platforms, and exploring new models of peer evaluation and recognition within the scholarly framework. We'll continue to engage with pilot communities to ensure the platform evolves to genuinely fit the needs of scientists.

#### **Customer FAQs**

#### **Q1: What is the benefit of using this platform instead of existing social media for discussing preprints?**

A1: This platform provides a dedicated, open, and trusted environment specifically for scholarly discourse around preprints, ensuring that your valuable discussions are discoverable, linked directly to the research, and contribute to your academic profile, unlike general social media platforms where conversations are often lost and uncredited.

#### **Q2: How will my contributions be recognized?**

A2: The platform is designed to help researchers get recognition for their contributions by linking engagement to researcher profiles and encouraging constructive, visible contributions. The goal is to make these discussions a more formally recognized part of scholarly communication.

#### **Q3: Is this platform open source?**

A3: Yes, Bonfire is free and open source software, meaning you can use and modify it freely, and benefit from future developments by the community.

#### **Q4: Can I connect with people on other social media platforms through this?**

A4: Yes, because the platform is built on the ActivityPub protocol, it can federate with other ActivityPub-enabled platforms (like Mastodon, PeerTube, etc.), allowing you to interact with a wider network while maintaining control over your community's data and privacy. You can follow accounts in Bonfire and from Bonfire 

#### **Q5: How will my data and privacy be handled on this platform?**

A5: Bonfire is designed to empower communities with control over their online activities in a safe and private environment. Each Bonfire community has the power to decide which information to share with others and which to keep on their instance.
