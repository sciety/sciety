# 1e. Extended nixOS/Guix and Bonfire federation experiments and documentation

## Notes W/c 21st Sept

- Email system now working on NixOS instances after database reset. We tested successfully with Protonmail and Gmail accounts. We're using the Sendgrid accoutnf that we set up for the main instance
- Cross-instance communication working within fediverse:
  - Mastodon to Bonfire private messages functional
  - Regular posts visible both ways
  - Following Masto and Ghost accounts works
  - Social flavor (dev-discussions) cannot seem to communicate with Open Science flavor (discussions), so we will try and rebuild where both instances run the same version, but it should be the case that any federated activity pub instance can communicate with another

## Next steps
- the ultimate goal is to get Open Science flavor running on NixOS for the project, so we'll focus on that for next week.
