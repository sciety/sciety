# NLNet Deliverables Index

## Task 1: Bonfire on nixOS deployment and replicability

Initial feasibility research through investigating and documenting methods for deploying Bonfire on nixOS.

- [1a. Comparative research of deployment options](./1a.md)
- [1b. nixOS and Bonfire deployment experiments and documentation](./1b.md)
- [1c. Guidance for deployment by research-communities](./1c.md)
- [1d. 1-click deployable Bonfire for Preprints (avoiding vendor lock-in)](./1d.md)
- [1e. Extended nixOS/Guix and Bonfire federation experiments and documentation](./1e.md)

## Task 2: Customisation of Bonfire for Preprints (€ 6000)

Assess existing efforts in the OpenScience.network space, design specific workflows for preprints and contribute back to the Bonfire ecosystem.

- [2a. Co-design sprint on bonfire features specific to preprints and workflow for DocMaps, COAR Notify, ORCID, ActivityPub, Badges and workflows](./2a.md)
- [2b. Initial deployment for customised bonfire MVP/dev/staging](./2b.md)
- [2c. Update Bonfire documentation](./2c.md)
- [2d. Final deployment for customised bonfire to production inc DNS setup eg. discussions.sciety.org](./2d.md)

## Task 3: Sciety integration (€ 20700)

Enable Bonfire activities to be linked to Sciety accounts/groups and preprints and implement reliable, time triggered connections between platforms.

- [3a. Creation of Sciety Bonfire extension](./3a.md)
- [3b. Configure bonfire ingestion](./3b.md)
- [3c. Configure broadcast eg via COAR Notify, getting data out of Sciety into the Fediverse](./3c.md)
- [3d. Research and design UI in Sciety for the integration](./3d.md)
- [3e. Update Sciety Documentation](./3e.md)
- [3f. Research and experiment with approaches for DocMaps integration](./3f.md)
- [3g. Refine Sciety Bonfire extension](./3g.md)
- [3h. Implement a UI/UX review in Sciety for the integration](./3h.md)

## Task 4: UX Research

Research and test user experiences of our early adopters in using federated preprint discussions.

- [4a. Identify risks in usability, accessibility, desirability, viability (for adoption)](./4a.md)
- [4b. Continuous user testing. Conduct and document user testing via Sciety blog resulting in multiple blogs posts](./4b.md)
- [4c. Final rounds of user testing. Conduct and document user testing via Sciety blog resulting in multiple blogs posts](./4c.md)

## Task 5: Extending configuration options for eLife ambassadors

Preparation for the pilot community adoption of federated preprint discussions.

- [5a. Create roles/privileges for eLife Ambassadors group](./5a.md)
- [5b. Create an openly licensed "playbook" for research communities on setup and role configuration](./5b.md)
- [5c. Preprint the research project and surface in new bonfire instance for discussion](./5c.md)
