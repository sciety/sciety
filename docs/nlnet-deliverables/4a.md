# 4a. Identify risks in usability, accessibility, desirability, viability (for adoption)


## Amazon style [Future PR](./future-PR-FAQ.md). 


A de-risking  exercise designed to reduce waste in software delivery and ensuring your solution will address the right problem, and that you understand and can articulate the problem. It is a written narrative articulating a product/feature in a way a customer would understand and make an informed decision on whether they want to try it out.

## [Story Map as of 30/06/2025](./story-map-30-06-25.jpg). 


[Story Maps were popularised by Jeff Patton](https://jpattonassociates.com/story-mapping/) and are a de-risking exercise that helps ensure you aren't building the right thing, the wrong way. A story map is structured as:

-  User activities across the top (light blue, horizontal axis)
- Tasks or steps underneath each activity (yellow, ordered by perceived value and in our case risk to the project)
- User stories or features supporting each task (orange, stacked vertically)

Teresa Torres also advocates for story mapping to uncover hidden assumptions in your solution. In our story map for An OpenScience flavour of Bonfire on NixOS for preprints we combine the strengths of both activities to unpack assumptions (pink) that  we may be making about the value being delivered.

This combination ensures that each slice is delivering value.

Whilst the initial story map represents the bulk of what will be delivered and is created at the beginning of the project, it will evolve over time as assumptions are tested and slices are released.
