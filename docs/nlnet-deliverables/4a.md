# 4a. Identify risks in usability, accessibility, desirability, viability (for adoption)


## Amazon style [Future PR](./future-PR-FAQ.md). 


A de-risking  exercise designed to reduce waste in software delivery and ensuring your solution will address the right problem, and that you understand and can articulate the problem. It is a written narrative articulating a product/feature in a way a customer would understand and make an informed decision on whether they want to try it out.

[Story Maps were popularised by Jeff Patton](https://jpattonassociates.com/story-mapping/) and are a de-risking exercise that helps ensure you aren't building the right thing, the wrong way. A story map is structured as:

-  User activities across the top (light blue, horizontal axis)
- Tasks or steps underneath each activity (yellow, ordered by perceived value and in our case risk to the project)
- User stories or features supporting each task (orange, stacked vertically)

Teresa Torres also advocates for story mapping to uncover hidden assumptions in your solution. In our story map for An OpenScience flavour of Bonfire on NixOS for preprints we combine the strengths of both activities to unpack assumptions (pink) that  we may be making about the value being delivered.

This combination ensures that each slice is delivering value.

Whilst the initial story map represents the bulk of what will be delivered and is created at the beginning of the project, it will evolve over time as assumptions are tested and slices are released.

[Assumption mapping, as advocated by David Bland](https://www.strategyzer.com/library/how-assumptions-mapping-can-focus-your-teams-on-running-experiments-that-matter), is a structured approach to identifying, visualising, and prioritising the assumptions that underpin a product or solution. The process helps teams surface what must be true for their solution to succeed, and to focus their efforts on testing the riskiest assumptions first.

Even though this project is committed to delivering a specific solution (an OpenScience flavour of Bonfire on NixOS for preprints) we recognise that every solution is built on a foundation of assumptions about users, their needs, the environment, and the value the solution will provide. By explicitly mapping these assumptions, we can:

- **Uncover Hidden Risks:** Assumption mapping helps us identify areas where we might be overconfident or where our knowledge is weakest, allowing us to address potential pitfalls early.
- **Prioritise Learning:** By ranking assumptions by risk and uncertainty, we can focus our research, prototyping, and validation efforts on what matters most, rather than spreading resources thinly.
- **Increase Stakeholder Alignment:** Making assumptions visible and explicit ensures that all team members and stakeholders share a common understanding of what needs to be true for success.
- **Adapt as We Learn:** As we test assumptions and gather evidence, we can adjust our approach, ensuring that the solution we deliver is both viable and valuable.

Incorporating assumption mapping into our process ensures that, even as we work towards a defined deliverable, we remain open to learning and adapting. This reduces the risk of building a solution that fails to meet user needs or deliver intended value, and increases our chances of successful adoption and impact.
