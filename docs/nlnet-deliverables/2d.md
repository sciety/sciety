# 2d. Final deployment for customised bonfire to production

Taking the kustomizations created in 2b, we hardened and exposed the deployment configuration, including:

- Wiring up DNS via our ingress automation to the final URL
- Ensuring backups were configured and conforming to our internal backup policies
- Providing for a path to auto-inject secrets from our secrets manager into the bonfire environment
- Configure transactional emails using our SendGrid account
- Enable ORCID integration
- Enable Zenodo integration
